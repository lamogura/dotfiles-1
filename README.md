Dotfiles
========

Configuration files and scripts typically stored in a Unix home directory.

`*extra` files
--------------

Some of these config files use the suffix `extra` instead of `rc`, e.g
`bashextra`.  Such files are intended to function via an `include` mechanism
of some kind from a primary config file.  This allows the primary config file
to be customized at will without affecting the "extra" satellite file.
